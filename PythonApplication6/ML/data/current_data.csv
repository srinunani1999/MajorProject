0,He was boring and ruined psychology for me. Nothing he ever said was clear and I would not recommend him if you want to pursue in psych. He's an easy grader but the pop quizzes everyday definitely made it hard to have a good quiz grade.,0.0
1,"extremely difficult course. I thought I was going to have to retake it (like many others have to.) The labs are insanely hard and quite time consuming, and the pop quizzes are challenging. I think the tests should have easier questions but be longer. If you miss 2 multiple choice, you drop a letter grade. this course is VERY TIME CONSUMING",1.0
2,Hard to understand at times. Tests are ok. Not too forgiving with grades.,1.0
3,SO glad to be the hell out of this class,0.0

5,Do not take her. She really is not interesting and is not a respectful individual. She treats her students like children. Take someone else. Very mean.,0.0
6,"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",0.0
7,"very good teacher loved the stories, i think he is one of the best on campus",1.0
8,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",1.0
9,"I feel like people over-react about this class sometimes. Sure, his tests are not easy and he really expects you to know the content, but people shouldn't expect hand-holding at this stage in the game. People complain about arrogance but he was always very respectful when I went to talk to him. Class really separates the men from the boys.",1.0
10,"This class was in the top two courses I've taken as a grad student at FIT. This course was challenging and extremely interesting. The discussion format of the course with his enthusiasm about swarm intelligence combined to create a fun and thought-provoking classroom atmosphere. The presentation and paper critiques were invaluable.One of the toughest classes out there, but he is one of the best teachers for it. Great guy, always willing to explain if somebody doesnt get it in the class. Is interested in the future of students; always asking for feedback. Very very tough grader, but one of the better CS majors.",1.0
11,"I find everything okay except the grading on tests. I am okay with labs; it doesn't take me long to understand the concepts and to apply them. On tests, if you miss 2 multiple-choice questions, you drop a letter grade!!! It's terrible.",1.0
12,Best calc teacher I could ask for. She is very clear about the expectations for quizzes/tests and teaches with examples that usually cover everything we are tested on. The lab sheets often have questions that are similar to the ones on the quizzes. Expect weekly homework on web assign and 3 group projects (easy). GSA was great too.,1.0
13,"the class is very important and you will use every thing you will learn in you career however, if you can find a different teacher i advise you too because he makes the class very heavy on the student. most students fail the first time. Good luck",1.0
14,"She is the best I ever had. She ginuinly cares about us, she want to know about our persinal life. She is always wiling to meet in her office. We even have her cell phone number. Strict, but fair. Ps:: she looks sexy in Facebook pictures",0.0
15,"She is my best teacher in this university. She speaks clearly, she gives such good examples, I can understand what she is talking about. I think she makes the boring class very fun and the time goes fast in her class. She really knows her topic and so she is passionate about it. She is strict with attendence and turning paper in time, but if yo",1.0
16,"She spends about five minutes on the lecture, and the rest of the time on applying whatever it is that we've learned, which is just how I like it. She's great about answering questions and clarifying anything you don't understand!",1.0
17,"He's an interesting teacher when he lectures but much (most) of the course is done by student presentations. The problem is if a student presentation is missing information and he forgets to cover it, you may not clearly get the information you need for the test. He's also very unorganized. He doesn't seem to have a plan when he gets to class, he just wings it. Getting an ""A"" in the course was a challenge- but possible! He would be a great professor if he would just get organized.",1.0
18,"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",1.0
19,"Best mathematics professor I have ever had. Always keeps class entertaining, and she makes the material really easy to understand. Great in class examples. Go to lab and do the practice tests and there is no reason you should not get an A.",1.0
20,"Good teacher with tough tests. Quizzes aren't too bad. She seems cruel at first, but after a few weeks she warms up to the class and tries to teach everybody the best she can. However, she isnt too good with outside the box, as in different random ways of doing things that aren't quite conventional.",0.0
21,"Every bad thing you see here is true. He is as confused about basic astronomy as I am about how he is a professor at all. The best I can say is that he isn't an intentionally mean or rude person, but I can't say that he's nice because he's so annoying to be around. You'll do better in his course if you don't show up at all to lectures.",0.0
22,"Being an engineer, classes like psych are hard for me, but I got an A in her class because she was very helpful, and rewards the amount of effort you put in. Fully recommended: participate in class, put the effort in, show her you're trying and you will score an A. Her being VERY CUTE makes the class so much more enjoyable as well ;)",0.0
23,"she is very passionate about the subject which is a bonus bc she taught it well.exams straight from textbook. shes not that bad, she does have a little attitude sometimes but not a reason not to take her. she doesnt give much of direction or instructions which was the only thing i didnt like bc i wasnt sure what exactly she wanted",1.0
24,"She is a great teacher, especially for C++! She teaches by lecture and example. She will teach about the basic concepts for the day by slide then she will show us some basic coding to get us to understand the concepts then we will dive into writing programs immediately!",1.0
25,"If Sheldon Cooper also taught this class, I would have chosen Sheldon Cooper over this professor.",0.0
26,This class is a shock to a lot of students because you actually need to study. If you study properly and don't procrastinate on the assignments you will be fine. He is a busy guy but if you try you will be able to get the help you need. He gives you past exams to help you study but you will need to actually understand the material to do well.,1.0
27,one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,0.0
28,He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,0.0
29,"Best calc/mth teacher at FIT. Engages your mind & comedy is part of her specialty. Drops 3 quizzes at end of semester (shh, I wasn't supposed to tell). Favorite saying: ""If you factor a variable out of an integral, I deny you were in my calc class (or I cross ur name off Dr. Knoll's known student list.) Take her. Teaching is her calling and gift.",1.0
30,She is an interesting person .. you can see her as a friend more than a doctor lolz,0.0
31,"Terrible at teaching, actually, she doesn't teach. She expects you to just understand the material without any instruction. Terrible.",0.0
32,Wouldn't surprise me if this guy turned out to be a fraud who's good at memorizing definitions from the book. I'd wager that his tests don't change that much from year to year because he doesn't understand the material well enough to make new tests. His GSA's are outstanding!,0.0
33,"Hard final, useless professor. Prints out the textbook outlines and copies it onto the projector in class, making lecture useless. College classes in general are self study, but for this class you are on your own. Good luck.",0.0
34,"the best comp. sci. teacher we have. he's really hard, but his teaching style forces you to learn. he makes you work for your grade such that each aspect ensures that you KNOW the material. better schools like berkeley and mit have teachers similar to him! so feel lucky to take a class with him!",1.0
35,"I love her to death! She is the nicest person in the chem department. She really will die trying to help you if you come to her office, and it usually makes all the difference. Lecture may lose you, but def go to her office for help. Tests/quizes not that hard, and her grading is super generous on quizes. Really wants to see you succede.",1.0
36,"He doesn't teach at all, takes him 30 mins to go over one question. It is so boring that you will fall asleep. Takes him forever to explain. He makes unfunny jokes. Good part is you will get a easy B or A, I got 60's for all his test, and I still got a A. Just come to class. and sleep. LOL",0.0
37,"Fantastic, friendly, fair, funny, fascinating, flawless, fastidious, fervent,forgiving, festive & foxy. As Dr. says: ""thesaurus dot com should be your best friend.""",0.0
38,"She is nice, and the class is really easy.",1.0
39,"She likes long writings, if you try to be short and clear you would probably get low grade. Give her exact answer that she wants if your answer has the same meaning as hers but phrased differently she won't accept it. She does not accept the fact the people have different opinions, if you in her class you should think like her, strict on grades.",1.0
40,Very difficult material. He tries to help make it clearer but he moves too fast. If you ask a question he makes you feel stupid. It is a required course and he is the only one teaching it so GOOD LUCK!!,1.0
41,This is worst class I ever took. She's a hard grader and she is very rude when it comes to trying to talk to students about grades. She hurt my GPA & I had to take an extra class in order to get my GPA higher. Please avoid this class.,1.0
42,"This is probably one of the best professors I have had. If you do not understand something, reach out to her as she will take the time to help you. It was because of this I was able to pass her class as at first I did not understand the material.",1.0
43,"He was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",1.0
44,She is not nice no matter what people are saying. I love math and i hated the way she was teaching it. I think she is fake with student and has a tendency to like only good students and not the one who struggle.,0.0
45,"Excellent professor! I was very pleased to be in his class this semester, as he has a breadth of knowledge outside the classroom. His grading style is tough, but it works well, I believe.",1.0
46,"Not all professors at FIT are great at teaching, they are brilliant but can't teach. She knows her content AND how to teach exceptionally well as a college professor.",1.0
47,This class has been a waste of time. She spends most of the time just talking about what we're going to learn. And then just lectures on about random current events. She doesn't set a clear objective for class each day. Pointless syllabus. I've learned almost nothing from her class and frankly I'm not sure she knows what she's doing as a professor.,0.0
48,"She's a great teacher! She seems a little nuts, but that's what makes her teaching awesome and funny!",0.0
49,Labs are unnecessarily hard and annoying. Tests are very tricky.,1.0
50,"What a joke, class average for the exams was less than 50, and more than half the class dropped. She should be ashamed of herself.",0.0
51,"Great professor, teaches all the content really well. She has never missed a class but will be late because she is spending so much time meeting students to help them out. Really smart and nice, just don't forget to call her Dr. Pay attention and do the homework and you'll do really well.",1.0
52,"He knows what he is teaching and he know what others thinking, you got a question ir your mind and he will gonna give you the answer even before u ask&#63; very tough in grading, everyone should take a course with him atleast once.",1.0
53,I took her for Developmental Math since my last Algebra class was more than 40 years ago. She is very willing to sit with you and explain problems and is genuinely wanting you to succeed. Managed with her help to take all 3 sections in one semester and get it done!,1.0
54,"Any professor that throws markers in frustration is a good professor. ^_^ All in all, my favorite math professor.",0.0
55,Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,1.0
56,"The professor is AMAZING. The class structure is AWFUL. If there was no lab portion for this class, everybody would get an easy A. BUT, the lab portion is the hardest part of this class. Some lab sections are led by ""instructors"" who don't know how to do anything. Lecture exams are based only on her slides and notes which is great because no book",1.0
57,Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,1.0
58,"That said, she was awful. Students would correct her all the time on simple problems, and she often couldn't answer things where there was legitimate confusion. She once wore her sweater backwards and inside-out and never noticed. She also ended class abruptly once after realizing she had written all over the white board with permanent marker.",0.0
59,I learned a lot this semester. Don't purchase the book as it is not used. He is a very harsh grader. The labs are very difficult. His tests SUCK. I attended all classes and failed all of his tests. He killed all of my career goals as a Computer Science professor. This class makes me want to kill myself!,0.0
60,His lectures inspire you to learn about the subject. The course is not very easy but is an essential for any CS student. Dr. is always willing to help you and explains the concepts in a clear way.,1.0
61,"Dr. is excellent. Her lectures go very fast you need to be focused. It is easy to let your grade slip, but as long as effort is put into the class it's fine. She is very passionate and has lots of energy.",1.0
62,"In a nutshell, this professor looks for every excuse to give students a bad grade. Even if you give him high-quality work, he will never have anything good to say about it and will always complain about even the smallest imperfections; a single small imperfections in your work could totally undermine a good grade.",1.0
63,"This is the worst professor that I have ever had. I ultimately ended up failing the course and I have never received lower than a B- for a lower grade. When I went into her office hours to address my grade, she wouldn't talk about past assignments and when asked if I could speak she said, ""no, because you are wrong."" Avoid this class!",1.0
64,I do not recommend her. She is hugely disorganized - all of the readings are on BB so I spent a fortune printing and the syllabus did not match the readings. The first half of the semester she spent telling the same 3 stories. Her assignments are stupid & the midterm was much too hard for this class. She only wants to hear what she believes.,0.0
65,"This professor is arrogant and does not care about his students. In fact, he seems to take pleasure failing students. Whenever he finds out you don't know something (like if you were to ask him a question), he will berate you for that. While he expects students to finish an exam in one hour, he stalls on grading the exams gives a lot of excuses.",1.0
66,"DO NOT TAKE HER! the class is ridiculously hard, the reading is equivalent to like 10 books and she just rambles on and on about how great Africa is. Uses all kind of propoganda to back her stuff up and she hates that shes white.",0.0
67,"Professor is a very kind lady. If you goto her office hours she really tries to help you understand the material. She's not the most organized, always running late, but she gives alot of oppurtunities to boost up your grade. If you need an extension she will give it to you. Goto office hours, study hard you'll do well. She grades fair.",1.0
68,"very good prof. class contains lots of reading. you dont have to do them all, but you must pay attention to what she saya. the midterm is fear, and the final is a take-home. she is extreamly nice...also, be very openminded in the class, and get ready to decunstruct all you've learned about africa.",1.0
69,"She's a real sweetheart. Attendance counts for this class, so at least make sure you show up. Her lectures are easy to follow and she covers everything needed for the homework or exams. She always makes it a point to tell you what types of problems you should focus on for the exams. Best teacher for a freshman Chem class.",1.0
70,"I think all of the nice comments were written by himself. &quot;Always willing to help&quot;, give me a break! Unfortunately he's the only one teaching this class.",1.0
71,"Gotta take this course. Even if you fail, you will end up doing yourself world of good. Whatever the heck be your major or reason to take the course, you get a chance, take it and put some effort, otherwise you will regret it for your entire life.",1.0
72,Simply amazing. She is very clear and likes to make things simpler rather than more complicated. Funny as well! If you study and do your homework you'll be more than fine!,1.0
73,"This professor is all over the place when teaching and can be difficult to keep up with. However, what I really enjoyed was his passion and knowledge on Puerto Rican studies. His assigned readings will help organize his lectures. There were two exams, the final was a 3-5 page paper and that was pretty much it.",1.0
74,"Prof. has a big course load. She does not make room for the students responsibilities outside of class. The books that she makes students buy are too expensive. She expects a lot from students but she doesn't deliver herself. Unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Her knowledge of social injustices are just that. She is smart but not wise. Avoid.",0.0
75,"Too much pride and arrogance. He thinks that just because he has a phD, he has the right to rub it in our faces that he is more knowledgeable than we are in Computer Science and arrogantly berate those who don't know what he knows. We don't need a professor who shoves it up our faces that he knows more than we do, we just need a prof who teaches.",1.0
76,"Yes, this class is time consuming. In my opinion, the lecture exams were easy as hell. You don't really need the textbook, because the prof puts all her notes and lectures slides up before lectures. Exams are based only from her notes (Not textbook). The Lab Portion, was easy as well. I had to put in alot of effort in memorizing, other than that A+",1.0

78,"average teacher, very very harsh grader",1.0
79,"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with him and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",1.0
80,"decent teacher, expect to work a lot, and don't expect a good grade.",1.0
81,"Hardest and Best teacher ever. If you get an A in his class you are destined for greatness. Most helpfull and approachable teacher in the Computer Science department. If you are lazy and not smart, don't take a course with him.",1.0
82,Cool!,0.0
83,Professor is an amazing person but not a professor who can teach you the physics that you need for the rest of your life. Its hard to understand her. exams and quizzes are not bad.. Just do homework and stay on top of the material on your own and you will get that A!,1.0
84,Terrible teacher and doesn't care to help his students in any way.,1.0
85,I absolutely love her. She makes math easy. Pretty funny and good for help outside of class.,1.0
86,"He teaches a tough class, but graciously curves as well. Tests are very hard, the labs aren't too bad. The semester long team project makes your grade for the most part. He is a fun teacher but loves playing devil's advocate in class discussions.",1.0
87,"This was a pretty boring class in my opinion. You don't really need the textbook, it was a waste of money. Just take notes on the power point slides and study the online quizzes .",0.0
88,"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1.0
89,Life Changing,0.0
90,"Nice teacher. Looks scary at first, but cares about your grade. Not entirely clear and sometimes doesn't explain things too well. Tests were difficult, but not impossible.",0.0
91,"Simply amazing. The classes are more like a group discussion than a lecture. Each student had to do give a presentation about a specific topic and write a paper by the end of the semester. We discussed the subject, ideas, helped each other and learned. We read a lot. There's a list of papers for each class. It definitely worth it. It's a great area",1.0
92,"Class consists of 5 writing assignments, in class midterm(short answers)and take home final. The assignments are easy if you actually do the readings and listen in class. Otherwise you'll find yourself stressing, looking over the thousands of readings on blackboard looking for the answers. She is really nice and understanding in person.",1.0
93,Lectures are long,1.0
94,"Her lectures are boring but attendance is mandatory. Videos shown in class will appear on tests. There are 4 exams, the final one cumulative and optional. She offers a lot of extra credit that will boost your grade. Read the book, study her slides, take occasional notes and you should do fine. The subject itself is interesting.",1.0
95,"Hum...He knows his stuff, but unless you already know yours, you aren't likely to learn much.",1.0
96,"I found it very hard to succeed in this class. You have access to past exams, but they're unanswered. It's difficult to study because you never know if your answer is correct, even with the internet. The labs are generally time consuming and of medium-hard difficulty, but you basically must get an A in the labs to get a C in the class.",1.0
97,"Plays around way too much in class, takes more time trying to be ""relatable"" than actually teaching anything.",0.0
98,"He is the one of the best professors i've had so far at FIT. His exams are tricky (not hard) and his grading is very strict, but that's because he really wants you to learn the material. I think everyone that is complaining about his class wants to get a good grade, without actually earning it.",1.0

103,"Psychology is an interesting topic i believe if you really want to learn more about it, than its good to ask questions after class. if you're there just to pass, i recommend to study the problem sets and beware of those quizzes. his quizzes are pretty tough but he gives the students tons of opportunities like writing assignment, studyQs.

270,"He is the absolute worst teacher that I have ever had. The lectures are very confusing, but the homework is pretty easy. The stuff on the homework is no where to be found on the tests and when you get the test it seems like its all totally new information. He is very nice and willing to help, but it doesn't make up for how bad of a teacher he is",1.0
271,Well... All I can say I that I showed up to every one of this guys class and I still somehow pulled a C out of nowhere... Thinks he is funny and tests are hard.. In class work has nothing to do with Web Assign homework.... GOOD LUCK,0.0
272,"He's so sweet, but not a professor I would recommend. You will never, ever use the book, so don't buy it. His exams are basically trick questions from all the sections, and he's looking for perfection. He's a hard grader and in my opinion, unfair.",1.0
273,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. (Applied Calc. 146) He is a nice guy overall, but is an absolutely terrible professor. His lectures are almost useless for the homework assignments,and his tests seem to be completely random things that are not covered well in class or the study guides. Plus, he grades very hard.",0.0
274,He is a nice guy. The problem is what he goes over in class and then what the assignments look like are two different things. If you don't want to be frustrated and feeling lost all the time avoid him at all cost's,0.0

276,"This guy lectures well but he is so soft spoken that it is imperative to sit right in front to hear him properly. The online homework took me a long time since I was new to Calculus, but it is the best way to learn the material. At one point he provided evidence to support Noah's flood and Earth's age which was a misuse of his position.",1.0
277,"He tries to crack jokes during class form time to time, some funny some others not so.

Waste of my hard earned money!",0.0

284,"He is a really nice guy and is willing to answer any questions, but he is terrible at teaching lectures!! The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",1.0
285,"While he was very enthusiastic about Math, (which I appreciated), he was also very insistent that everyone understood everything quickly, without time to really practice what we had just learned.

293,TERRIBLE. Absolutley hated his class. He just assumes everyone understands the information and never asks if you actually get it or not. Also he moves really fast through the material which can be a bad thing when he sucks at teaching it.,0.0
294,Avoid! At the start of the semester I looked at this site on him and it was a 1.9 I didn't think much of it I figured just as long as I show up to class and do the work I will do fine.

2241,She enjoys filling her lectures with examples that explain very easy concepts and quickly skims over the complex material. Attendance gives you extra credit and she puts these examples on the exams. She also puts very specific details from the textbook onto the tests. If you want an A you will have to read the book.,1.0

2253,"The actions of Dr. prove how the academic system is truly unfair. She gave me a low grade on my final exam essay and when i asked her why she said it was because i only provided 4 answers to the question instead of 10.

2257,I was in the Libby RAP program and she was the best. You have reading assignments from the book that will help you a lot on the tests. She's extremely encouraging and has a lot of great stories and examples to help you remember the materials. She also loves when people come to office hours. I'd definitely recommend her!,1.0
2258,"Going to class is very beneficial as she often puts questions on the test that you would only know from attending lecture.

2263,"Diane is awesome!!! She is always available to offer help and gives you everything you need to get an A in her classes. If you don't get an A it's because you're lazy and incompetent.

2270,"Great teacher, made this topic tolerable and even a little fun. Did not own book, but managed to do all the HW just fine, which means she explained the material in a practical way and provided all the info needed to learn. Pros are: fun, energetic, organized, fair, caring. CONS: Notes are light, concept tests are HARD and confusion. Tests feel 80's",1.0
2271,"Avoid at all costs, unless you are an over achiever. I recieved two A's on exams, and because I never came to class, she felt the need to average them out with two D's. She takes off way too many unneeded points if she feels you are doing too well, while not coming to her class.",1.0
